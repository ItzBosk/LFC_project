## Prerequisites
This software requires Java, which is a versatile, object-oriented programming language, renowned for portability, used for web, desktop, and mobile applications.

### Installation of Java
*If you already have Java JRE ( or OpenJDK alternative ) installed and working in your machine you can skip this installation process*

Installing Java can be broken down into five simple steps:

**Step 1: Prepare Your Computer**

Ensure your computer is connected to the internet, and you have administrative privileges to install software.

**Step 2: Download Java**

1. Open your web browser (like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox).
2. In the address bar, type "Java download" and press Enter.
3. Look for the official Java download page, typically provided by Oracle or OpenJDK. Click on it to open the page.

**Step 3: Choose the Right Version**

1. On the Java download page, you will see different versions of Java. You'll often find two main types: JDK (Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
2. You only need Java to run existing Java programs, so download the JRE.
3. Click on the download link for the version you need. It's usually labeled as "Download" or something similar.

**Step 4: Accept the License Agreement**

1. After clicking the download link, you'll be taken to a page with a license agreement. Read through it if you like, then look for a checkbox that says "I agree to the Oracle Technology Network License Agreement."
2. Check this box to indicate your agreement.
3. Click the download link again.

**Step 5: Install Java**

1. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file. It's often an executable file with a ".exe" extension on Windows or a ".dmg" file on macOS.
2. Double-click the downloaded file to run the installer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Java. Typically, you can use the default settings unless you have a specific reason to customize them.
4. The installer will complete the installation process, and you'll see a confirmation when it's done.

That's it! You've successfully installed Java on your computer. You can now use Java to run Java applications like our SPL Software
