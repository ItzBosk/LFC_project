## Prerequisites
This software requires Java, which is a versatile, object-oriented programming language, renowned for portability, used for web, desktop, and mobile applications.

### Installation of Java
*If you already have Java JRE ( or OpenJDK alternative ) installed and working in your machine you can skip this installation process*

Installing Java can be broken down into five simple steps:

**Step 1: Prepare Your Computer**

Ensure your computer is connected to the internet, and you have administrative privileges to install software.

**Step 2: Download Java**

1. Open your web browser (like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox).
2. In the address bar, type "Java download" and press Enter.
3. Look for the official Java download page, typically provided by Oracle or OpenJDK. Click on it to open the page.

**Step 3: Choose the Right Version**

1. On the Java download page, you will see different versions of Java. You'll often find two main types: JDK (Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
2. You only need Java to run existing Java programs, so download the JRE.
3. Click on the download link for the version you need. It's usually labeled as "Download" or something similar.

**Step 4: Accept the License Agreement**

1. After clicking the download link, you'll be taken to a page with a license agreement. Read through it if you like, then look for a checkbox that says "I agree to the Oracle Technology Network License Agreement."
2. Check this box to indicate your agreement.
3. Click the download link again.

**Step 5: Install Java**

1. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file. It's often an executable file with a ".exe" extension on Windows or a ".dmg" file on macOS.
2. Double-click the downloaded file to run the installer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Java. Typically, you can use the default settings unless you have a specific reason to customize them.
4. The installer will complete the installation process, and you'll see a confirmation when it's done.

That's it! You've successfully installed Java on your computer. You can now use Java to run Java applications like our SPL Software

### How SPL works
Creating Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) code can be a fun, creative way to write programs. Imagine you're telling a story with two characters, and they need to talk to each other, and they also move around. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Characters**: Pick two characters. These can be any names you like, such as "Romeo" and "Juliet." Each character will represent a stack (like a pile of books).

2. **Settings**: You need to set the stage. Give the characters some places to move to, like "Verona" and "Balcony."

3. **Initialization**: Start with a scene-setting line, like "Verona. A room."

4. **Enter and Exit**: You can make your characters enter and exit with lines like "Romeo, enter" and "Juliet, exit." When they enter, it's like they are starting to do something, and when they exit, they are done.

5. **Actions**: Use the characters' names to push and pop values onto their stacks. For example, if Romeo is supposed to say something, you might use "Romeo: Listen to me!" This tells Romeo to say something.

6. **Interactions**: If you want Romeo and Juliet to talk to each other, you can have them "Listen to" each other's words. For example, "Romeo: Listen to Juliet."

7. **Conditionals**: You can create conditions with phrases like "If Romeo is the same as Juliet," and then you specify what to do if they are the same or different.

8. **End**: Finish your code with a line like "Juliet, exit." This means Juliet is done.

9. **End Scene**: Finally, end the scene with a line like "End the scene."

Remember, in the Shakespeare Programming Language, you're not writing typical code like in other programming languages. Instead, you're creating a story where the characters and their actions represent the code's logic. It's a fun way to write code, almost like writing a play or a script!

#### Script example
You can write something like this in order to obtain "UniBG Rules!" as output:

**DA CORREGGERE**
```
The Adventure of UniBG Rules.

Juliet, a bright student with a sunny disposition.
Romeo, a passionate scholar with fiery determination.

[Setting the stage]
[University of Bergamo, a place of higher learning.]

Juliet: Listen to me!
Romeo: You are the sum of yourself.

[Juliet's declaration]
Juliet: Open your mind!
Romeo: You are the sum of yourself.

[The wisdom of Romeo]
Romeo: You are the square of yourself.
Juliet: Remember yourself.

[The grand revelation]
Romeo: You are the sum of yourself.
Juliet: You are the difference between yourself and yourself!

[Juliet's joy]
Juliet: Speak your mind!
Romeo: Open your heart.

[The final decree]
Juliet: Listen to me!
Romeo: You are the sum of yourself.

[Exiting]
Juliet: Remember me.

[Ending the play]
```
