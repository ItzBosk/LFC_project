The Counting Game.

Romeo, a young man used for comparisons.
Juliet, a sweet woman used as a counter.


Act I: The counter.
Scene I: The spacing scene and the counter.
[Enter Romeo and Juliet]

Romeo:
You are the sum of yourself and a moon.
Open your heart.

Juliet:
You are the difference between a fair healthy pretty sunny warm lovely cat and a handsome amazing old red King.    
You are the sum of yourself and a small fat pig.
Speak your mind.

Juliet:
You are not the sum of a beautiful amazing Lord and a golden good handsome proud Hell.
Juliet:
You are the difference between yourself and a green King.


Scene II: The loop scene.
Romeo:
Am I better than you?

Juliet:
If so, let us return to scene I.
[Exeunt]
